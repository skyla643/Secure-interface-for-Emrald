Secure Interface Summary

The secure interface, a Python script, utilizes the Fernet encryption scheme from the cryptography library for encrypting and decrypting messages, ensuring both data confidentiality and integrity. 
Upon execution, the script generates an encryption key if absent, saving it to encryption_key.txt, and prompts the user for a message to encrypt. It then encrypts and saves the message to encrypted_message.txt. 
For decryption, the script reads the encryption key, decrypts the message, and prints it to the console. The interface guarantees secure encryption and decryption, protecting sensitive information.

Implementation Steps:

Install the cryptography library.
Generate the encryption key.
Develop and test encryption and decryption functions.
This interface underscores the importance of data protection in user interfaces, enhancing security and integrity through encryption, thus minimizing risks of eavesdropping or tampering.

Additional Notes:

Future Access: Plan to make it SSH accessible and compatible with Mac OS.
Accessibility: Aim for compatibility beyond Windows.

When you see: "Your file" it means that is the name of your C file, I made this in visual studio, and didn't want to expose my file c name.
