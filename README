SecureCrypt, a Python script, implements the Fernet encryption scheme from the cryptography library to ensure robust encryption and decryption of messages, guaranteeing both data confidentiality and integrity. Upon execution, the script automatically generates an encryption key if absent, saving it to encryption_key.txt, and prompts the user for a message to encrypt. It then securely encrypts and stores the message to encrypted_message.txt. For decryption, the script reads the encryption key, decrypts the message, and displays it to the console. The SecureCrypt interface ensures secure encryption and decryption processes, safeguarding sensitive information effectively.

Implementation Steps:

Install the cryptography library.
Generate the encryption key.
Develop and test encryption and decryption functions.
SecureCrypt underscores the paramount importance of data protection in software interfaces, enhancing security and integrity through encryption, thereby mitigating risks of eavesdropping or tampering.
